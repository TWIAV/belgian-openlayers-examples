# OpenLayers example: basemap Belgium

In this demo web mapping application, based on [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/), a simple basemap of Belgium is shown, with WMTS layers served by the Belgian National Geographic Institute (<https://www.ngi.be/>).

Follow this link to see the application in action: <https://twiav.nl/be/basiskaart/>

Or you can zoom in directly to a certain location (in this case: Bruges) with a certain basemap (here: the ortophoto): <https://twiav.nl/be/basiskaart/#map=15/571224/712171/0>

Do you want to play around with the code?

Requires [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/).
